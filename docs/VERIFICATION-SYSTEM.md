# Alumni Verification System

This document explains the verification badge system implemented for the EEE Alumni Portal.

## Overview

The verification system allows administrators to mark alumni profiles as verified, providing visual indicators of authenticity and distinguished status.

## Verification Types

### 1. Standard Verification (White Badge)
- **Field**: `verified`
- **Value**: `1` = verified, `0` = not verified
- **Appearance**: Gray/white checkmark badge
- **Purpose**: Indicates the profile has been verified by administrators

### 2. Blue Verification (Blue Badge)
- **Field**: `blue_verified`
- **Value**: `1` = blue verified, `0` = not blue verified
- **Appearance**: Blue checkmark badge (Facebook-style)
- **Purpose**: Indicates distinguished alumni with notable achievements

## Implementation

### Excel File Structure

The `alumni_new.xlsx` file now includes two additional columns:
- `verified`: Number (0 or 1)
- `blue_verified`: Number (0 or 1)

### Priority System

If an alumni has both `verified = 1` and `blue_verified = 1`, only the blue badge will be displayed (blue verification takes priority).

### Visual Design

The verification badges are designed to match Facebook's verification system:
- **Blue Badge**: Blue background with white checkmark
- **Standard Badge**: Gray background with white checkmark
- Both badges include subtle gradients and shadows for a professional appearance

## Usage

### Adding Verification to Alumni

1. **Via Excel File**:
   - Open `data/alumni_new.xlsx`
   - Set `verified` column to `1` for standard verification
   - Set `blue_verified` column to `1` for blue verification
   - Save the file

2. **Via Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/add-verification-columns.js
   ```
   This script automatically adds the verification columns with sample data.

### Component Usage

The `VerificationBadge` component can be used independently:

```tsx
import { VerificationBadge } from '@/components/ui/verification-badge';

// Blue verification badge
<VerificationBadge type="blue_verified" size="md" />

// Standard verification badge
<VerificationBadge type="verified" size="lg" />
```

### Available Sizes
- `sm`: Small (16px)
- `md`: Medium (24px) - default
- `lg`: Large (32px)

## Files Modified

1. **Components**:
   - `components/AlumniCard.tsx` - Updated to display verification badges
   - `components/ui/verification-badge.tsx` - New reusable badge component

2. **Data Structures**:
   - `lib/alumni-data.ts` - Updated interface to include verification fields

3. **Scripts**:
   - `scripts/add-verification-columns.js` - Script to add verification columns to Excel

4. **Excel File**:
   - `data/alumni_new.xlsx` - Updated with verification columns

## Best Practices

1. **Blue Verification**: Reserve for truly distinguished alumni (executives, notable researchers, public figures)
2. **Standard Verification**: Use for confirmed alumni profiles
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent criteria for verification across all profiles
4. **Documentation**: Keep records of why specific alumni received verification

## Future Enhancements
