# Featured Alumni System

This document describes the Featured Alumni system implementation for the EEE Alumni website.

## Overview

The Featured Alumni system showcases the most distinguished graduates who have made exceptional contributions to their fields. It follows the same design and structure as the regular alumni system but is limited to 50 featured alumni.

## File Structure

### Data Files
- `data/featured_alumni.xlsx` - Excel file containing featured alumni data
- `scripts/create-featured-alumni-excel.js` - Script to generate the featured alumni Excel file

### API Routes
- `app/api/featured-alumni/route.ts` - API endpoint for featured alumni data

### Pages
- `app/featured-alumni/page.tsx` - Featured alumni page component

### Images
- `public/images/feature_alumni/` - Directory for featured alumni profile images

## Data Structure

The Featured Alumni system uses the same data structure as the regular alumni system:

```typescript
interface FeaturedAlumniMember {
  Name: string;
  Batch: string;
  Position: string;
  Institute: string;
  Email: string;
  Photo: string;
  Point?: number;
  LinkedIn?: string;
  Facebook?: string;
  Instagram?: string;
  verified?: number;
  blue_verified?: number;
}
```

## Excel File Columns

The `featured_alumni.xlsx` file contains the following columns:
- **Name** - Full name of the featured alumni
- **Batch** - Graduation batch (e.g., "1st", "2nd", etc.)
- **Position** - Current job title/position
- **Institute** - Current workplace/organization
- **Email** - Contact email address
- **Photo** - Image filename (stored in `/public/images/feature_alumni/`)
- **Point** - Achievement points (85-98 for featured alumni)
- **LinkedIn** - LinkedIn profile URL
- **Facebook** - Facebook profile URL
- **Instagram** - Instagram profile URL
- **verified** - Verification status (0 or 1)
- **blue_verified** - Blue verification status (0 or 1)

## Features

### Card Design
- Identical to regular alumni cards
- Profile image with hover effects
- Name with verification badges
- Batch information
- Professional details (position, institute, email)
- Social media links
- Responsive grid layout

### Verification Badges
- Blue verified badge for highly distinguished alumni
- Gray verified badge for verified alumni
- Badges appear inline with the name

### Sorting
- Alumni are sorted by achievement points in descending order
- Higher points indicate greater achievements

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/featured-alumni
Returns the list of featured alumni.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "Name": "Dr. Rashida Sultana",
      "Batch": "1st",
      "Position": "Chief Technology Officer",
      "Institute": "Microsoft Bangladesh",
      "Email": "rashida.sultana@microsoft.com",
      "Photo": "rashida_sultana.jpg",
      "Point": 98,
      "LinkedIn": "https://linkedin.com/in/rashida-sultana",
      "Facebook": "https://facebook.com/rashida.sultana",
      "Instagram": "https://instagram.com/rashida_sultana",
      "verified": 0,
      "blue_verified": 1
    }
  ],
  "count": 50
}
```

## Image Management

### Image Path
All featured alumni images should be placed in:
```
public/images/feature_alumni/
```

### Image Naming Convention
- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with underscores
- Use `.jpg` extension
- Example: `rashida_sultana.jpg`

### Fallback Image
If an image is not found, the system automatically falls back to `/placeholder-user.jpg`.

## Generating New Data

To regenerate the featured alumni Excel file:

```bash
node scripts/create-featured-alumni-excel.js
```

This will create a new `featured_alumni.xlsx` file with 50 featured alumni records.

## Page Access

The featured alumni page is accessible at:
```
http://localhost:3000/featured-alumni
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Falls back to hardcoded data if Excel file is not found
- Displays loading states during data fetching
- Shows error messages if API calls fail
- Provides retry functionality

## Customization

### Adding New Featured Alumni
1. Add the alumni data to the Excel file
2. Place their profile image in `/public/images/feature_alumni/`
3. The system will automatically load the new data

### Modifying the Limit
To change the 50 alumni limit, modify the loop in `create-featured-alumni-excel.js`:
```javascript
for (let i = 6; i <= 50; i++) { // Change 50 to desired number
```

## Performance Considerations

- Images are optimized using Next.js Image component
- Data is sorted server-side for better performance
- Responsive grid layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Hover effects are GPU-accelerated for smooth animations

## Future Enhancements

- Search and filter functionality
- Pagination for large datasets
- Individual featured alumni detail pages
- Achievement categories and awards
- Timeline view of achievements
